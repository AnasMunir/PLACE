# PLACE (Planning based Language for Agents and Computational Environments)
PLACE endows the agents with planning capability. We are
interested in the temporal planning of on the fly goals having
different priorities. The environment is modeled visually to help the user
simulate the behavior of agents and see the execution of agentsâ€™
plans.
